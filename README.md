## README for Logistic Regression on Sonar Dataset

### Overview:

This project focuses on implementing a logistic regression model to classify sonar signals as either "M" (Mines) or "R" (Rocks). The dataset used contains 208 samples with 60 feature columns and one target column.

### Libraries Used:

- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- `numpy`: For numerical operations.
- `sklearn`: For machine learning tasks like model selection, splitting data, and metrics.
  - `LogisticRegression`: To implement the logistic regression algorithm.
  - `train_test_split`: To split the data into training and test sets.
  - `accuracy_score`: To evaluate the model's performance.

### Data Collection and Processing:

- The dataset (`sonar-data.csv`) was loaded using the `pandas` library.
- The data contains 208 samples with 60 features and a target column.
- Descriptive statistics were used to understand the distribution and characteristics of the data.
- The target column is nearly balanced with 111 Mines and 97 Rocks.

### Model Training:

1. **Data Splitting:** 
   - The dataset was split into training (90%) and test (10%) sets using `train_test_split`.
   
2. **Model Initialization and Training:**
   - A logistic regression model was initialized using `LogisticRegression()`.
   - The model was trained on the training data using `model.fit(X_train, y_train)`.

### Evaluation:

- After training, the model was used to predict on the test set.
- The accuracy of the model was evaluated using the `accuracy_score` metric, which resulted in an accuracy of approximately 76.19%.

### Making Predictions:

- The model is capable of predicting whether a sonar signal corresponds to a rock or a mine.
- A sample input data can be fed to the trained model to make predictions.

### Instructions to Run:

1. Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed (`pandas`, `numpy`, and `scikit-learn`).
2. Clone the repository.
3. Navigate to the project directory.
4. Run the Python script.
5. Follow the on-screen instructions or modify the script to input custom data for predictions.

### Conclusion:

This project demonstrates the application of logistic regression for classification tasks. While the model achieved a reasonable accuracy, further optimizations and advanced techniques can be explored for better performance.
